- **Add ExpectedPowerShelf/ExpectedSwitch ToProto conversions onto db models** ([#467](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/467))
  Adds `ToProto` methods on Expected PowerShelf and Expected Switch DB models, matching the pattern established for Expected Machine.

- **Apply expectedMachineToProto helper to batch handlers** ([#456](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/456))
  Extends the proto conversion helper to the batch create and batch update handlers for Expected Machine.

- **Define proto-builder helpers for ExpectedMachine/Switch/PowerShelf API handlers** ([#451](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/451))
  Extracts reusable proto builder helpers used across Expected component API handlers, reducing code duplication.

- **Use existing protobuf API label-conversion helper across handlers** ([#452](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/452))
  Replaces inline label-to-proto conversion code with the existing shared helper function across all handlers.

- **Reuse pre-fetched Site in Expected Component GET handlers** ([#449](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/449))
  Eliminates redundant Site lookups in Expected Component GET handlers by reusing the Site object already fetched during authorization.

- **Drop unused tclient.Client from expected API handlers** ([#448](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/448))
  Removes the unused Temporal client dependency from Expected component API handlers, simplifying handler construction.

- **Configure Bun to discard unknown columns for DB queries** ([#437](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/437))
  Enables Bun ORM's `DiscardUnknownColumns` setting so retired database columns are silently ignored during SQL scans, easing the transition window between struct removal and column migration. *(Also in v1.4.1)*

## [v1.4.0](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/releases/tag/v1.4.0)

> [!NOTE]
> This release is compatible with Core **v0.8.x**.

### Features

- **Add support for filtering VPCs by NVLink Logical Partition** ([#380](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/380))
  VPCs can now be filtered by their associated default NVLink Logical Partition ID. Other VPC filters have also been enhanced to accept multiple values, and network security group filter validation has been improved. See the updated query parameters on [Retrieve all VPCs](https://nvidia.github.io/infra-controller-rest/#tag/VPC/operation/get-all-vpc).

- **Allow setting routing profile when creating VPCs** ([#350](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/350))
  Callers can now include `routingProfile` when creating a VPC with FNN network virtualization. The field is only accepted for FNN-type VPCs and is reflected in the API response accordingly. See the `routingProfile` field on [Create VPC](https://nvidia.github.io/infra-controller-rest/#tag/VPC/operation/create-vpc).

- **Allow power control to NSM and PSM without registration** ([#368](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/368))
  NVSwitch Manager and PowerShelf Manager can now receive power control commands (on/off/cycle) without requiring prior component registration, simplifying initial rack bring-up workflows.

- **Update Site Agent Helm chart to adopt Core prereqs for installation** ([#416](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/416))
  Updates the README and Helm chart to reference the `helm-prereqs` chart from infra-controller-core as the recommended installation path for bare-metal cluster setup. Also adds username keys to the common DB credentials secret template.

- **Hint at label filter syntax after TUI list output** ([#406](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/406))
  After running a list command in the TUI, a context-sensitive hint now displays available label keys and the syntax for `--label`, `--sort-label`, and `scope label` filtering. The hint is suppressed once any label filter is active.

- **Add user-defined task schedules** ([#392](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/392))
  Extends the RLA scheduler to support user-defined task schedules, allowing operators to configure custom recurring jobs beyond the built-in inventory sync and leak detection schedules.

- **Add support for Delta PMC vendor in Powershelf Manager** ([#331](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/331))
  PSM now supports Delta as a power shelf vendor alongside the existing Liteon support, broadening hardware compatibility for power management.

- **Support explicit rule ID override in RLA sequence requests** ([#404](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/404))
  Callers can now specify an operation rule by ID when submitting rack operations, bypassing the normal priority chain (rack association, default, hardcoded) and using the requested rule directly.

### Bug Fixes

- **Reject DB connection when no encryption** ([#428](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/428))
  Restores the PostgreSQL SSL mode from `disable` (introduced accidentally in v1.1.0 during a DSN builder refactor) back to `prefer`, so that the client attempts TLS first and falls back gracefully. This fixes connection failures against Postgres servers that only accept encrypted connections via `hostssl` rules.

- **Add Site Agent manager for VPC Peering and fix workflows** ([#424](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/424))
  Adds the missing VPC Peering manager to the Site Agent and fixes VPC Peering workflows to correctly require the VPC Peering ID during creation on Site.

- **Mark ipBlockId as required in VPC Prefix create request** ([#414](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/414))
  Corrects the OpenAPI schema and CLI/TUI to reflect that `ipBlockId` is a required field when creating a VPC Prefix, matching the server-side validation that already enforced this. See [Create VPC Prefix](https://nvidia.github.io/infra-controller-rest/#tag/VPC-Prefix/operation/create-vpc-prefix).

- **Prompt for allocation constraints in TUI allocation create** ([#413](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/413))
  Fixes the TUI allocation creation flow to properly prompt for the required constraint (resource type, IP block selection, constraint type, and value), which was previously missing.

- **Send protocolVersion and routingType on IP block create** ([#412](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/412))
  Fixes IP Block creation in the CLI/TUI by including the `protocolVersion` and `routingType` parameters that were previously omitted from the request, causing creation failures.

- **Fix Expected Machine OpenAPI misnamed fields for BMC default credentials** ([#421](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/421))
  Corrects field names for BMC default username and password in the Expected Machine OpenAPI schema, resolving mismatches between the spec and the actual API behavior. See [Expected Machine](https://nvidia.github.io/infra-controller-rest/#tag/Expected-Machine) endpoints.

- **Resolve RLA inventory component manager ID sync issue** ([#409](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/409))
  Ensures machine IDs are synced on every inventory loop iteration, removing a conditional skip that could leave `external_id` stale and cause leak detection to fail. Also updates default operation timeouts and fixes misleading error messages in component target resolution.

- **Update SSH Key Group status after successful sync to Site** ([#411](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/411))
  Fixes a bug where the overall SSH Key Group status was not updated after a successful sync to a Site — only the per-site association status was being set, leaving the parent resource in a stale state.

- **Prevent duplicate --data flag panic on carbidecli create commands** ([#401](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/401))
  Fixes a panic in `carbidecli dpu-extension-service create` (and similar commands) caused by a flag name collision when a request body property is named `data`. Colliding properties are now registered under a `body-` prefix.

- **Resolve required query param for tenant-account list in TUI** ([#408](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/408))
  Fixes the TUI tenant-account list command that was failing due to a missing required query parameter.

- **Error when flags are placed after a positional argument in carbidecli** ([#400](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/400))
  Adds detection of misordered flags placed after positional arguments in `carbidecli`, providing a clear error message instead of sending a malformed HTTP request.

- **Remove deprecated Instance/Allocation relationships** ([#371](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/371))
  Completes the transition from per-instance allocation linkage to aggregate allocation enforcement. Instance creation now validates against total reserved capacity for a tenant's instance type at a site, and allocation constraint updates check against total instance usage. See the updated [Allocation](https://nvidia.github.io/infra-controller-rest/#tag/Allocation) schema.

- **Move machine ID lock acquisition before record pull** ([#405](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/405))
  Fixes a race condition in instance creation where the machine record could become stale between initial read and lock acquisition. The lock is now acquired before pulling the record, ensuring all subsequent checks operate on current data.

- **Fix OpenAPI URL for IP Block, SSH Key/Group and Tenant Account in TUI/CLI** ([#397](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/397))
  Corrects 20 URL path segments in the TUI that were using hyphenated display names instead of the actual API paths (e.g., `ip-block` instead of `ipblock`), fixing silent 404s on list, get, create, update, and delete operations for these four resource types.

- **Revise Allocation status enum and attribute descriptions in OpenAPI spec** ([#395](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/395))
  Aligns the Allocation status enum values in the OpenAPI schema with database constants (e.g., `Registered` was missing), fixing deserialization errors when listing Allocations. Adds comprehensive attribute descriptions across Allocation models. See the updated [Allocation](https://nvidia.github.io/infra-controller-rest/#tag/Allocation) schema.

- **Infer Provider/Tenant from org for Site update and Fabric retrieval endpoints** ([#372](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/372))
  Extends org-based identity inference to Site update and Fabric retrieval endpoints, removing the need to pass `infrastructureProviderId` or `tenantId` query parameters. See updated parameters on [Update Site](https://nvidia.github.io/infra-controller-rest/#tag/Site/operation/update-site) and [Retrieve all Sites](https://nvidia.github.io/infra-controller-rest/#tag/Site/operation/get-all-site).

- **Support reflashing the same firmware version in PSM** ([#393](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/393))
  Allows PowerShelf Manager to re-apply the same firmware version that is already installed, enabling recovery scenarios where a re-flash is needed without a version change.

- **Include IP block flag in VPC prefix create log** ([#426](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/426))
  Updates the CLI hint text for VPC Prefix creation to include the required IP Block flag.

### Refactoring

- **Create generic Execute interface and workflow/activity registries in RLA** ([#419](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/419))
  Introduces a generic `Execute` interface and type-safe workflow/activity registries in the RLA task executor, replacing ad-hoc registration with a structured pattern. Consolidates shared execution logic, adds comprehensive registry tests, and improves discoverability of available actions.

### Documentation

- **Add Getting Started section in OpenAPI schema** ([#402](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/402))
  Adds a [Getting Started](https://nvidia.github.io/infra-controller-rest/#section/Getting-Started) section to the API documentation, providing a clear onboarding path for new users. HTTP 200 and 201 responses are now auto-expanded for better discoverability of response schemas.

### CI/CD

- **Reduce tests duration by up to 36%** ([#431](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/431))
  Optimizes PostgreSQL test container configuration by trading durability for speed (disabling fsync, full page writes, and synchronous commit), reducing local test runs from ~10:38 to ~6:46.

- **Add Grype container vulnerability scan to build-push-service** ([#418](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/418))
  Integrates Grype as an additional container vulnerability scanner in the Docker build-and-push workflow, complementing existing security scanning.

- **Add GitHub workflow to ensure Core protobuf is up to date** ([#391](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/391))
  Adds a CI check that verifies generated protobuf code matches the current proto files, preventing drift between proto definitions and generated Go code.

### Chores

- **Clean up deprecated workflows/activities in Site Agent** ([#375](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/375))
  Removes legacy workflows and activities from Site Agent that have been superseded by the Site Workflow module. Deletes custom proto objects that had drifted from Core. Retained workflows for Temporal CLI based deletion now have a `ByID` suffix for clarity.

- **Switch from deprecated attributes for VPC Prefix create/update request to Site** ([#423](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/423))
  Migrates VPC Prefix create and update API handlers from deprecated Core proto attributes to their current replacements.

- **Add back standard SDK module after repo rename** ([#265](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/265))
  Re-adds the standard SDK Go module that was removed during the repository rename, fixing import paths. SDK consumers should update imports to `github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/sdk/standard`.

- **Configure NSM and PSM to run in-memory mode by default** ([#410](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/410))
  NVSwitch Manager and PowerShelf Manager now default to in-memory firmware storage mode, eliminating the PostgreSQL dependency for these services in standard deployments.

- **Update Instance creation API test, validate unhealthy Machine flag sent to Core** ([#407](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/407))
  Strengthens Instance creation tests to verify the `allowUnhealthyMachine` flag is correctly forwarded to Core.

- **Fix idempotency issue for warning comments in Core proto format script** ([#389](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/389))
  Makes `make core-proto-fmt` fully idempotent by preventing duplicate warning comment and block insertion on repeated runs.

- **Re-generate Core protobuf to align with latest proto files** ([#390](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/390))
  Runs `make core-protogen` to sync generated Go code with the current `*_carbide.proto` definitions on the main branch.

## [v1.3.0](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/releases/tag/v1.3.0)

> [!NOTE]
> This release is compatible with Core **v0.7.x**.

### Features

- **Add system job scheduler in RLA with trigger and overlap policies** ([#352](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/352))
  Replaces ad-hoc inventory sync and leak detection go-routines with a structured scheduling framework. Each job is defined with a configurable trigger (timer, cron, trigger-once, or event-driven), an overlap policy, and a worker, providing graceful and forceful shutdown support.

- **Add support for updating InfiniBand Partition data on Site** ([#334](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/334))
  Implements end-to-end InfiniBand Partition update propagation to the Site Controller. The API handler now starts a site workflow after a successful update to REST DB cache, wiring through proto definitions, Temporal workflows, and activities consistent with the existing create/delete patterns.

- **Add net.HardwareAddr wrapper for BMC MAC JSON marshaling** ([#369](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/369))
  Introduces a `net.HardwareAddr` wrapper type that provides proper JSON marshaling and unmarshaling for BMC MAC addresses, replacing raw byte-slice serialization with human-readable colon-separated format.

### Bug Fixes

- **Include name in update request of NVLink Partition Update** ([#373](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/373))
  Ensures new or existing partition name is included in NVLink Logical Partition update requests to Site, since Site expects the update request to reflect the full data.

- **Require TLS certs by default for RLA/PSM/NVSM and IPAM server** ([#333](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/333))
  RLA, PSM, and NSM now refuse to start without TLS certificates unless `ALLOW_INSECURE_GRPC=true` is explicitly set, hardening the default security posture. Also IPAM gRPC server now supports/requires TLS specification.

- **Update default firmware update sequence for NSM to only include BMC and BIOS updates** ([#376](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/376))
  Narrows the default NSM firmware update sequence to BMC and BIOS components only, excluding unnecessary sub-component updates that could cause longer maintenance windows.

- **Prepare for Machine/InstanceType Association ID deprecation** ([#367](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/367))
  Adds Machine ID as a replacement for Instance Type/Machine Association ID for removal of assignment, introduces a dated deprecation window for association IDs and enabling clients to migrate smoothly.

- **Include NVLink and InfiniBand Interfaces while cleaning up Instance resources** ([#366](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/366))
  Fixes instance termination cleanup to also delete associated NVLink and InfiniBand interfaces, preventing orphaned network interface records. Includes a DB migration to remove previously orphaned interfaces.

- **Harden scheduler dispatcher correctness and unit tests of RLA** ([#364](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/364))
  Eliminates shared-state race conditions in the scheduler dispatcher by using `forceCtx` as the parent for all job contexts, fixes event-draining on queue exhaustion, and replaces timing-sensitive tests with deterministic assertions.

- **Added status field in NVLink Interface summary API model** ([#363](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/363))
  Adds the missing `status` field to the NVLink Interface summary API model, allowing consumers to view interface status when listing NVLink Interfaces within an NVLink Partition.

- **Fix bringup sequence, NSM stale records, and unify tray/rack type enums** ([#377](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/377))
  Addresses several issues found during rack bring-up and firmware update testing: replaces the default BringUp rule's ingestion-based power-on with standard `PowerControl` to avoid BMC MAC lookup failures, restructures firmware upgrade sequencing from parallel to staged execution (compute then NVLSwitch then power recycle), fixes Temporal serialization loss of `FirmwareControlTaskInfo` across child workflow boundaries, filters stale firmware update records in NSM's `GetUpdatesForSwitch` to prevent old failures from masking current successes, and unifies component type enum naming across Tray and Rack API endpoints to PascalCase (`Compute`, `NVLSwitch`, `PowerShelf`, etc.).

- **Add dev mode for RLA service** ([#360](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/360))
  Introduces an `RLA_ENV` environment variable that gates development-only features: gRPC reflection is enabled only in dev mode, and the log level defaults to debug in dev mode versus info in production, preventing accidental exposure of diagnostic interfaces in deployed environments.

- **Skip config filter in DB if no config query params are set when retrieving all Sites** ([#379](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/379))
  Fixes a bug where the Site list handler unconditionally applied an empty JSONB config filter, causing sites with a NULL config column to be silently excluded from results. Site listing now only applies config filtering when at least one config query parameter is explicitly provided.

- **Maintain association record when Instance Type is updated in Machine inventory** ([#383](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/383))
  When a Machine's Instance Type changes during inventory sync, the Machine/InstanceType association record is now updated alongside the Machine attribute itself, keeping both representations consistent until the association ID is fully deprecated.

- **Have PSM read firmware files at startup time rather than using an embedded filesystem** ([#385](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/385))
  Switches PowerShelf Manager from compile-time embedded firmware binaries to runtime file loading at startup, allowing firmware images to be updated by replacing files on disk without recompiling the service.

### Refactoring

- **Require Ready status for targeted machine instance creation** ([#357](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/357))
  Targeted instance creation now enforces that the specified machine must be in `Ready` status or in `Error` (health alerts) or `Maintenance` status with the Core state being `Ready` (when `allowUnhealthyMachine` flag is set).

### Chores

- **Replace hardcoded API name in path in TUI using helper** ([#356](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/356))
  Replaces all 86 hardcoded `/v2/org/{org}/nico/...` path strings in the TUI with calls to a new `apiPath` helper, making path construction consistent with the SDK's configurable API name support.

- **Rename Site Agent and mock Core/RLA server binary** ([#365](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/365))
  Renames Site Agent and mock server binaries as part of the Site Agent v2 preparation, and removes residual database references from the stateless agent.

- **Update Core proto and improve firmware update sequencing in RLA** ([#361](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/361))
  Aligns RLA snapshot of Core proto, improves firmware version matching between input requests and observed state, and enables RLA to update the `firmware_autoupdate` flag for machines.

- **Update Core proto snapshot for REST components** ([#251](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/251))
  Introduces an idempotent `make core-proto` script that automates Core proto file snapshotting with handling for backwards-incompatible changes and REST-specific additions. Also removes deprecated non-paginated object retrieval fallback methods from Site Agent.

- **Add changelog with detailed history of released tags up to v1.2.1** ([#359](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/359))
  Adds a comprehensive CHANGELOG.md with professional descriptions for every pull request across all 12 released versions.

---

## [v1.2.1](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/releases/tag/v1.2.1)

> [!NOTE]
> This release is compatible with Core **v0.6.x**.

### Features

- **Allow Instance Interfaces to span multiple VPCs** ([#300](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/300))
  Instances can now attach interfaces to VPC prefixes from different VPCs, enabling multi-VPC networking per instance. The primary interface must still belong to the instance's primary VPC, and NSG propagation status now reflects the aggregate state across all attached VPCs.

- **Infer Tenant/Provider context from org when retrieving Allocation/Instance Type** ([#217](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/217))
  Removes the requirement for callers to pass explicit `infrastructureProviderId` and `tenantId` query parameters on Allocation and Instance Type endpoints by inferring identity from org membership. Dual-role users now receive a merged view from both provider and tenant perspectives in a single call.

- **Modify NSM and PSM Vault credential format to match NICo's standard pattern** ([#341](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/341))
  Aligns the credential format that NVSwitch Manager and PowerShelf Manager expect in Vault with the standard credential pattern used by NICo, ensuring consistency across component managers.

- **Revise PatchComponent, add DeleteRack, PurgeRack, PurgeComponent gRPC APIs in RLA** ([#320](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/320))
  Extends RLA gRPC APIs with soft-delete and permanent purge operations for racks and components. PatchComponent now supports BMC updates, improving rack lifecycle management capabilities.

- **Add Tenant Account search query and fix tsquery parsing** ([#315](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/315))
  Implements the `query` parameter for tenant account listing, enabling search by account number, tenant org, or display name. Also fixes a bug where multiple consecutive spaces in search queries would generate invalid PostgreSQL `to_tsquery` syntax, causing 500 errors.

### Bug Fixes

- **Aggregate NVSwitch sub-component firmware statuses in NICo path in RLA** ([#355](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/355))
  Fixes a map-overwrite bug where only the last sub-component firmware status survived per switch when Core returned multiple statuses (BMC, CPLD, BIOS, NVOS). An aggregation function now correctly reports failure if any sub-component fails, and missing switches are reported as Unknown.

- **Prevent UpdateTaskStatus from overwriting started_at with NULL in RLA task executor** ([#354](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/354))
  The `started_at` column was unconditionally included in UPDATE statements, causing finished-status writes to overwrite the stored timestamp with NULL. The column list is now built dynamically so `started_at` is only set during the Running transition.

- **Align PMC Vault path with Core/NSM** ([#353](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/353))
  Corrects the Vault path used for storing PMC credentials in PowerShelf Manager to match the convention used by Core and NVSwitch Manager, resolving credential lookup failures.

- **Correct child workflow timeout/error and improve compute firmware update lifecycle in RLA** ([#348](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/348))
  Fixes timeout budget miscalculation where child workflows shared the same timeout as individual activities, leaving no room for retries. Also adds fail-fast firmware version validation against Core, idempotent scheduling for already-complete machines, and proper error attribution when steps are skipped.

- **Make PSM registration credentials-optional and idempotent** ([#347](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/347))
  PowerShelf Manager registration no longer requires credentials upfront, and re-registration of the same shelf is now safely idempotent rather than returning an error.

- **Only report inherited VPC propagation when interfaces are attached** ([#342](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/342))
  NSG inheritance from parent VPCs is now only reported when interfaces are actually attached to instances, preventing misleading propagation status on instances with no active interfaces.

- **Prevent modification of virtualization type for VPCs with Subnets or Instances** ([#343](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/343))
  The API now rejects virtualization type changes for tenant-owned VPCs that already have attached subnets or instances, preventing disruptive configuration changes on in-use VPCs.

- **Normalize MAC address case in NSM/PSM vault credential lookups** ([#345](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/345))
  Fixes a case mismatch between Go's lowercase MAC addresses and Core's uppercase Vault paths that caused credential lookups to silently fail in NVSwitch Manager and PowerShelf Manager.

- **Auto-migrate NSM database schema on startup** ([#340](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/340))
  NVSwitch Manager now applies database migrations automatically on startup, matching the existing behavior of PowerShelf Manager and eliminating manual migration steps.

- **Add health-report override and idempotent power-option handling in RLA** ([#335](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/335))
  RLA power control now properly marks machines with health-report overrides before operations and cleans them up afterwards. Power state transitions that are already in the desired state are treated as no-ops instead of failing the entire operation.

- **Add 10 MiB request body size limit to prevent OOM** ([#330](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/330))
  Adds a global 10 MiB request body size limit using Echo's BodyLimit middleware, preventing the audit body middleware from buffering arbitrarily large payloads and eliminating an OOM crash vector for authenticated mutating endpoints.

### Chores

- **Infer Provider and Tenant ID from org association when creating Operating Systems** ([#344](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/344))
  Removes unnecessary `TenantID` and `InfrastructureProviderID` parameters from OS creation, since both are already derivable from the caller's org association.

- **Add HTTP read/write/idle timeout in Echo config** ([#339](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/339))
  Configures well-defined read, write, and idle timeouts for the HTTP server, mitigating potential Slowloris-style denial-of-service attacks.

- **Tune RLA power operation timer configuration** (no PR)
  Adjusts timer settings for RLA power operations to better accommodate real-world operation durations.

- **Add detailed review config for CodeRabbit** ([#337](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/337))
  Updates CodeRabbit configuration to provide more contextual and well-informed automated code reviews.

- **Add codeowners file to repository** ([#295](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/295))
  Introduces a CODEOWNERS file so reviewers are automatically assigned to pull requests based on file ownership.

- **Optimize NVLink Logical Partition lookup in Instance update API handler** ([#332](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/rest-api/pull/332))
  Replaces inefficient one-at-a-time DB lookups of NVLink Logical Partitions with a batch query, and adds proper distinction between internal DB errors and non-existent partitions.
