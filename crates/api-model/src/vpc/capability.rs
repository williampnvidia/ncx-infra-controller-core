//! Profile-driven capability policy for `VpcVirtualizationType`.
//!
//! Each VPC virtualization type maps to a single `VpcCapabilities`
//! profile that declares its policy answers as data, e.g.
//! - Which host fabric interface it attaches to.
//! - Which segment types it accepts.
//! - Whether it honors routing profiles.
//! - Whether it supports IPv6.
//! - Which VPC types it peers with.
//! - Etc...
//!
//! The methods on the `VpcVirtualizationTypeCapabilities` extension
//! trait just read from that profile.
//!
//! The idea is that adding a new VPC virtualization type means:
//! (1) Add the enum variant in the `network` crate.
//! (2) Declare a `VpcCapabilities` constant here.
//! (3) Add the arm in `VpcVirtualizationTypeCapabilities::capabilities`.
//!
//! ...and then hopefully you have limited code changes you need to
//! make (e.g. less match arms, less conditional branching, etc etc).
//!
//! Technically most of this is serde-serializable, so we could maybe
//! even some day drive it from config files.
//!
//! This also introduces a DataPlaneKind enum, which gives us an
//! additional level of flexibility in how we define the capabilities
//! of a VPC virtualization type, with the idea being we should be
//! able to express how different data plane types wire into our
//! business logic, letting us derive a certain collection of
//! capabilities based on this kind. It's also intended to make it so
//! certain mutually exclusive configs can't cause a misconfiguration.
